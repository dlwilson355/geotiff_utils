# GeoTIFF Utilities
This code is taken from some other projects.
It provides easy high-level functionality for working with GeoTIFF files in python, such as reading and writing withing geospatial coordinates, performing coordinate transforms, reading metadata, ect.
It uses the Python bindings for [GDAL](https://gdal.org/index.html) underneath the hood.
